    <h2>Choomba</h2>
    <h3>Artist</h3>
    <p>
      There's always something fresh in the waters of Australian dance music and eyes from all over the globe look here for exciting young talent. Right on cue in  2019, Choomba came out of the gate with a debut EP that hit  #4 on the overall Beatport Release Chart,  #36 on Australia’s overall Shazam Chart and saw them up for the Triple J Unearthed feature artist spotlight - it’s been all rapid uphill since those first crazy weeks. Now they are selling out venues around the country and seem to be everywhere.
