    <h2>Masked Wolf</h2>
    <h3>Artist</h3>
    <p>Transforming from a mild-mannered man by day into an unrestrained beast in the studio, Masked Wolf (aka, Harry Michael) has unassumingly established himself as a powerful, passionate, and primal hip-hop force. After graduating from school, the Sydney, Australia native tirelessly worked in sales to fund recording. He even took out a loan to build a home studio as he cut hundreds of songs and logged thousands of hours in the lab. In 2018, he dropped his independent debut “Speed Racer.” It gathered millions of streams and turned heads across Australia. Following “Night Rider” and “Water Walkin,” he unveiled “Astronaut in the Ocean.”
